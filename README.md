This is my first "big" game that I was creating from the scratch. 

In the game Player need to survive as long as he can. At night waves of Zombies spawn. Enemies follow player and hurt him whenever they collide with him.
Player can use 3 kinds of weapons: pistol, machine gun and sniper rifle. Every type of weapon can be upgraded by money you get after finishing wave.
Enemies upon killed can drop health packs and ammo to weapons.
